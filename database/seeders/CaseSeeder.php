Floods can cause extensive damage to property, infrastructure, and can pose serious risks to human life. Knowing what to do before, during, and after a flood can help keep you and your loved ones safe.",
                'Before'=>"Monitor weather forecasts and flood warnings from local authorities. /Assemble an emergency kit with essential supplies such as water, non-perishable food, a first aid kit, flashlight, batteries, and important documents. /Develop a family emergency plan that includes evacuation routes, meeting points, and communication methods. /If you live in a flood-prone area, consider installing flood barriers, sump pumps, and moving electrical outlets and appliances to higher levels.",
                'During'=>"Listen to the radio or check official sources for updates and instructions from local authorities. /If you are advised to evacuate, do so immediately. Follow designated evacuation routes and do not attempt to drive through flooded areas. /Move to higher ground if you are trapped in a building or if floodwaters are rising. Avoid basements and lower floors. /Avoid walking or driving through floodwaters. Just six inches of fast-flowing water can knock you off your feet, and two feet of water can float a car.",
                'After'=>"Wait for authorities to declare it safe before returning home. Be cautious when entering a flooded area, as floodwaters can hide hazards such as debris, downed power lines, and contamination. /Inspect your home for damage before entering. Look for signs of structural damage, gas leaks, electrical damage, and sewage contamination. /Take photos of any damage to your property and belongings for insurance purposes. /Throw away any food, water, or medication that may have come into contact with floodwaters.",
                'Prevention_Tips'=>"Keep gutters and drains clear of debris to allow water to flow freely away from your home. /Elevate electrical outlets, switches, sockets, and appliances at least 12 inches above the expected flood level. /Install a sump pump and a backflow valve in your basement to prevent water from backing up into your home.",
